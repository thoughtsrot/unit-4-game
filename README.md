# unit-4-game

##### Bootcamp Takeaway #####

The purpose of this application is to demonstrate use of basic jquery syntax to dynamically create html elements (writing to the DOM).

By utilizing "on-click" event listeners, the application can capture user inputs to allow the user to interact with the application in a simple counting strategy game with a randomized target number and randomized counting increments. 

##### Basic Gameplay #####

At the start of a new game, a target number is displayed along with several clickable crystals. Each crystal is assigned an on-click event and a random "counting" value. The user will then have to determine the best way to reach the target value by combining crystal values.

The challenge is the count must be exact and the user will need to identify and then memorize which value belongs to which crystal.
